# Speaker-Profiles Docker Environment Configuration
# This is the Docker-optimized version of .env with container-specific paths

# REQUIRED: HuggingFace Access Token
# Get your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# This is required for accessing pyannote.audio models
HUGGING_FACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token_here

# Model Cache Directories (optimized for Docker containers)
# These paths are within the container (/app)
TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/app/pretrained_models/transformers
HF_HOME=/app/pretrained_models/huggingface
SPEECHBRAIN_CACHE=/app/pretrained_models/speechbrain

# GPU Configuration (automatically handled by Docker)
# Leave empty for CPU-only containers, or set specific GPUs for multi-GPU systems
# CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1  # Use specific GPUs
# CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""   # Force CPU-only mode

# Application Settings (Docker optimized)
PYTHONPATH=/app
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Audio Processing Settings
# Maximum audio file size in MB (adjust for your needs)
MAX_AUDIO_SIZE_MB=500

# Speaker Recognition Settings
# Default similarity threshold for speaker matching
DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.75

# Minimum speech time to process a speaker (seconds)
MIN_SPEECH_TIME=2.0

# Quality threshold for speaker embeddings
MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.3

# Container-specific paths
# These are mounted from the host system
